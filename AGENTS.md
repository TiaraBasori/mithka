# Repository Instructions

- Always use `master` instead of `main` as the branch name.
- Do not use Material, Cupertino, or built-in Material/Cupertino icon sets in the app. Use the project's `AppIcon`, `HeroAppIcons`, and owned image assets instead.
- Describe and implement designs through concrete properties such as dimensions, spacing, corner radius, color, border, shadow, typography, and motion. Do not use another product as design shorthand.

## Contributions and agentic PR review

- These review rules govern agentic source-code and PR reviews. All store versions must remain compliant with the applicable Telegram API Terms; accepting guarded source code is never an exception for App Store, Google Play, or other store distribution or review.
- Every PR must complete `.github/pull_request_template.md`, including a Telegram API Terms classification and evidence for the basic checks. This applies to features, fixes, refactors, documentation, and build/automation changes.
- Review the actual behavior and all affected entry points before deciding whether a feature is allowed. Classify the PR as compliant/unchanged, a section 1.4 exception, or disallowed/unresolved. An unresolved classification blocks approval and merge.
- A section 1.4 exception may be accepted only when its entire implementation is guarded by the compile-time `allowTelegramTosViolations` constant from `lib/config/build_flags.dart`, controlled by `I_DONT_FUCKING_CARE_ABOUT_TOS`. A runtime setting or a hidden UI control alone is insufficient.
- Guard every affected UI element, route, command, callback, background task, TDLib/native action, and registration. With the flag omitted or `false`, the feature must be absent and ordinary Telegram behavior must remain intact, including when old saved settings request the feature.
- The flag defaults to `false`. Enable it only for an explicit self-build with `--dart-define=I_DONT_FUCKING_CARE_ABOUT_TOS=true`. Official release, nightly, TestFlight, and store builds must keep it `false`; do not add an official build option or configuration that enables it. Dedicated CI tests may enable it to verify the guard.
- For a section 1.4 exception, require tests and relevant build/UI evidence for the omitted, explicit `false`, and explicit `true` variants. Verify that the default/false variants have no prohibited effects and that the true variant works only through the guarded entry points. The flag is a contribution boundary; it does not make the behavior compliant with Telegram's terms.
- Basic checks must cover formatting, analysis, relevant tests, affected build/platform paths, and applicable localization/generated-file checks. Record the commands and results; an inapplicable check needs a concrete reason. Applicable Quality CI checks must pass before merge.
- Agentic reviewers must inspect the completed checklist and supporting evidence, confirm the classification, and check the guards themselves. Do not approve or merge a PR with missing classification, unchecked applicable checks, failing checks, unguarded section 1.4 behavior, or a way to enable the flag in official builds. Ask for changes when the evidence is insufficient.

### Telegram API Terms section 1.4

Source: [Telegram API Terms of Service](https://core.telegram.org/api/terms).

> **1.4.** It is forbidden to interfere with the basic functionality of Telegram. This includes but is not limited to: making actions on behalf of the user without the user's knowledge and consent, preventing self-destructing content from disappearing, preventing last seen and online statuses from being displayed correctly, tampering with the 'read' statuses of messages (e.g. implementing a 'ghost mode'), preventing typing statuses from being sent/displayed, etc.
