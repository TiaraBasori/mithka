## Change

Describe the problem, resulting behavior, and affected platforms. Link related issues if applicable.

## Telegram API Terms classification

Follow the [contribution and agentic review rules](https://github.com/iebb/mithka/blob/master/AGENTS.md#contributions-and-agentic-pr-review). Select exactly one classification and explain it below.

This is an agentic source-code review classification. Every store version must remain compliant with applicable Telegram API Terms; the guarded-source exception does not apply to store distribution or review.

- [ ] Compliant/unchanged: this change complies with applicable Telegram API Terms, preserves Telegram's basic functionality, and does not introduce behavior covered by section 1.4.
- [ ] Section 1.4 exception: the entire feature is guarded by `allowTelegramTosViolations` (`I_DONT_FUCKING_CARE_ABOUT_TOS`), disabled in official builds, and available only in an explicitly enabled self-build.
- [ ] Disallowed or unresolved: this PR must not be approved or merged until its classification and implementation are resolved.

Reason and affected Telegram behavior:

## Basic checks (every PR)

Check each item after verification. If a check is inapplicable, explain why in the evidence below before checking it.

- [ ] I reviewed the diff for correctness, unintended behavior, secrets, and unrelated changes.
- [ ] Formatting passed, or I recorded why it is inapplicable: `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed lib test integration_test test_driver`.
- [ ] Analysis passed, or I recorded why it is inapplicable: `flutter analyze`.
- [ ] Relevant tests passed, or I recorded why they are inapplicable; name the commands and test cases below. Quality CI runs `flutter test --concurrency=4`.
- [ ] I checked affected build/platform paths and applicable localization/generated files; list the evidence below.
- [ ] I completed the Terms classification above and verified that official builds cannot enable section 1.4 exceptions.

Commands, results, platform/build/UI evidence, and reasons for inapplicable checks:

## Section 1.4 exception checks

Complete every item for an exception. For a compliant/unchanged PR, write `Not applicable` here.

- [ ] All UI, routes, commands, callbacks, background work, TDLib/native effects, and registrations use the compile-time guard; a runtime preference alone cannot enable the feature.
- [ ] With the flag omitted, the feature is absent and ordinary Telegram behavior remains intact, including with old saved settings.
- [ ] With `--dart-define=I_DONT_FUCKING_CARE_ABOUT_TOS=false`, the feature is absent and ordinary Telegram behavior remains intact.
- [ ] With `--dart-define=I_DONT_FUCKING_CARE_ABOUT_TOS=true`, the feature works through the guarded entry points in a self-build; I included relevant test and build/UI evidence.
- [ ] Official release, nightly, TestFlight, and store builds keep the flag `false` and have no option that enables it. All store versions remain compliant with applicable Telegram API Terms.

Guard locations and evidence for each flag variant:

## Agentic reviewer confirmation

Agentic code reviewer only: record this confirmation in the PR review or check these boxes before approval.

- [ ] I independently confirmed the Terms classification and inspected all required guards and evidence.
- [ ] Applicable checks and Quality CI pass; no unresolved classification or unguarded section 1.4 behavior remains.
